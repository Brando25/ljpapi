Libre Java Pathfinder API
=========================

A Java class library for storing Pathfinder RPG data.

Hacking
-------

The code should match the style of existing source, following official Java
brace and indentation style. Try to keep lines below 80 columns, but exceptions
can be made due to the verbose nature of Java as a language.

Submissions can be made via GitHub's pull request system or [e-mail][1].
