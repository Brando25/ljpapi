Libre Java Pathfinding API
==========================

A Java class library for storing RPG data.

Build
-----

The NetBeans IDE is used in developing this library, which generates `ant`
build scripts by default. You can either load the project in NetBeans yourself,
or you can build with `ant` like so:

    $ ant clean jar

The environment variable `JAVA_HOME` needs to point to a valid JDK for the
command-line build to work.

Hacking
-------

The code should match the style of existing source, following official Java
brace and indentation style. Try to keep lines below 80 columns, but exceptions
can be made due to the verbose nature of Java as a language.

Submissions can be made via GitHub's pull request system or [e-mail][1].
